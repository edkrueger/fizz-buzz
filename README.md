# fizz-buzz
Shows and times non-functional and functional approaches to mapping a numeric vector to string vector.

The problem is to map a vector of integers to a vector of strings with the appropriate fizz, buzz and fizzbuzz values.

Both the non-functional and functional approach will reply on a function called `fizz_buzz` (fizzBuzz for you JavaScript fans).
If an integer is divisible by 3, then `fizz_buzz` will return `"fizz"`. If an integer is divisible by 5, `fizz_buzz` will return `"buzz"`. However, if an integer is divisible by both 3 and 5, `fizz_buzz` will return `"fizzbuzz"`. Otherwise, `fizz_buzz` will simply return the integer converted to a string (i.e. `fizz_buzz(2)` will return `2`).
